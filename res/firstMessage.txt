You were on a secret mission onboard a spaceship, when suddenly you were attacked by an alien vessel.
You're standing in your room, red lights are flashing and the computer voice keeps repeating:
"Warning! Intruder alert! Power core offline, emergency power only!"
You're wondering what to do, will you stay here hiding, or try to save the ship?
