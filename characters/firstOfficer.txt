First Officer
1:AAAAAAAA NO PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!!!
1:Oh... uhh... you're not an alien. Umm, who are you?
1:Ooh! The janitor! I remember seeing you on this ship before.
1:Do you have any medicine? My whole body hurts from hiding in these crates.
2:Do you have any medicine? My whole body hurts from hiding in these crates.
3:Thanks, I feel much better. The captain was abducted and the aliens demand we give them the files about our secret mission.
3:We can't let the captain die, since I am now in command of the ship, I say we give it to them.
3:They are in the captain's room. Some of the aliens might still be here and I am much higher ranking than you,
3:so can you go get them for me? The password to the captain's room is #.
3:The files are classified so don't look in them!
3:I'll just... hide in one of these crates until you come back.
4:Bring me the files.
5:Great, now we need to deliver them to the alien ship. Use the shuttle in the dock to get to the alien ship.
6:Use the shuttle in the dock to get to the alien ship.
